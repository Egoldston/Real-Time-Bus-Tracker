# Real Time Bus Tracker
## Description:
In this project, the user creates a custom map that displays bus routes. It shows buses moving their routes in real-time. It uses  Google Maps and Google Maps API. 

## How to Run:
Copy or fork the repository to your computer then open the "index.html" file in a browser. You will need to add your Google Maps API key to where it says "ADD_API_KEY_HERE". This shoould result with a map and markers showing you a bus route. 

## Roadmap for future improvements:
I plan on customizing the map more and adding more features and markers for other landmarks/routes or maybe add topography.
